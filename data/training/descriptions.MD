**0a938d79:** The agent will need to understand that it should find the two colors in the black colored sequence.  Then it will need to create an alternating pattern in between the two colors.

**0b148d64:** The agent will need to realize that it must locate the pattern with a unique color against the others.  It will need to learn that all patterns are split by the gray blocks.  When it finds this pattern, it will need to copy it directly to build the output.

**0ca9ddb6:**  The agent will need to add a unique pattern block to the left and right of blue or red tiles.  These should overlap all other tiles, including black and other colors.  All other that are not red or blue are left unchanged.

**0d3d703e:**  The agent will need to learn mappings from input colors to output colors.  These mappings will need to be learned from several samples.
