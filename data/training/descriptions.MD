**0a938d79:** The agent will need to understand that it should find the two colors in the black colored sequence.  Then it will need to create an alternating pattern in between the two colors.

**0b148d64:** The agent will need to realize that it must locate the pattern with a unique color against the others.  It will need to learn that all patterns are split by the gray blocks.  When it finds this pattern, it will need to copy it directly to build the output.

**0ca9ddb6:**  The agent will need to add a unique pattern block to the left and right of blue or red tiles.  These should overlap all other tiles, including black and other colors.  All other that are not red or blue are left unchanged.

**0d3d703e:**  The agent will need to learn mappings from input colors to output colors.  These mappings will need to be learned from several samples.

**00d62c1b:** The agent will learn how to flood fill between two green tiles.  All other tiles will be ignored, it will fill in the back between two green.

**0dfd9992:** The agent will need to learn how to complete the corrupted sequences by looking at other parts.  NOTE:  ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR THIS MAY BE TO MAKE THE EXACT SAME PATTERN IN ONE OF THE SAMPLES, AND CORRUPT THE INPUT SO MUCH THAT THE AGENT WILL NEED TO USE THE OUTPUT SAMPLE AS A REFERENCE.  THIS WOULD IMPLY THE AGENT WILL REMEMBER DETAILS FROM PRIOR SAMPLES, INSTEAD OF JUST TRANSFORMS.

**0e206a2e:** The agent will need to learn how to find similar shapes (flipped or non-flipped) consisting of red yellow and blue.  It will use this to know how to change the color from black to the color found with the similar shape.  It will then need to remove the colored version of the shape by replacing it with black.

**1a07d186:** Gravity attractors, the agent will need to learn to pull all tiles of the same color towards the largest clusters.  It should remove all instances of tile colors that do not have a cluster.  A cluster is a set of tiles of the same color greater than 1.

**1b2d62fb:** Agent needs to learn that we need to take the intersection between the subsequence before the middle tile and after, and mark only those where black appears in both.

**1b60fb0c:** Agent needs to learn to flip the pattern on the right, onto the left side of the first blue tile, and change the color to red.

**1bfc4729:** Agent needs to complete the shape starting from whereever the colored tiles are in the sequence and stretching the same shape to the edges.  The shape always has one black tile after the first colored tile.

**1c786137:** This one has a difficult time fitting into 1D.  Original used the same colored boxes, but in 1D it is more subtle.  The agent needs to find the pattern between two contiguous subsequences which are the same color, which only appear twice in the sequence.

**1caeab9d:** This was originally an alignment strategy in ARC.  This has been changed to moving the selected items into their correct slots as alignment doesn't work in 1D, unless we align to one side but that is too close to other problems.

**1cf80156:** Simple cropping operation.  Remove all black tiles not part of the sequence shape.

**1e0a9b12:** Horizontal gravity.  The agent needs to learn how to slide all of the blocks to the right most side s.t. there exists no black tiles between them.

**1e32b0e9:** Although the structure of this problem translates to 1D quite well, it is actually difficult for a human to see what is going on.  In this case, we are completing the object in the first 1x6 block with the partition block's color in the remaining 1x6 blocks.
